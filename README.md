encode3-curation
================

This is my collection of IPython notebooks to document some of the work I've done
to try and curate the Wold Lab's data submissions to the ENCODE-DCC.

Originally I just started sharing it so I could show my work to our super data wrangler.

However I then started writing some notebooks that might be considered useful documentation.
